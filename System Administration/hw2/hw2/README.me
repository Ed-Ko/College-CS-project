This homework emphasizes on shell script, students have to write a one-line shell script and a graphical user management system using dialog in FreeBSD.


Part1. One-line script
       In this part, the requirement is to write a one-line script. This script can only exist one line shell command and produce 3 text files.
       Input file is "auth.log" under "/var/log/", and output files are "audit_ip.txt", "audit_sudo.txt" and "audit_user.txt".
       
       Here are my steps to produce the 3 files : 
       
       (1). First remove the square brackets from every line in "auth.log" and Initialize the variable belongs to "awk" command that will be useful
            in subsequent steps. For the 3 files, create 3 built-in hash maps of command "awk", the hash maps function as arrays and record the require content
            with correct format(key : number of lines that are matched, value : required output with required order).
            p.s : notice thath 3 files are handled in the same time, i.e, I used 3 "if" statements to check every line in "auth.log" and select matched
                  line to corresponding statement for further processing.
            
       (2). Let's deal with "audit_sudo.txt" first. For every line in "auth.log", if a user use command "sudo", there is a word "sudo" in that line.
            However ,extract all the lines that have this word also extract lines which are not exactly describe the details of a certain user using sudo command.
            That's why we also look for key word "COMMAND=" in lines contain word "sudo".
            After selecting matched lines, remove unwanted characters and reorder the line. Pushing it into corresponding hash map is the final step.
       
       (3). For "audit_user.txt", we need to find the lines that contain users who try to ssh into this machine but failed. Word "sshd" represents the message
            from ssh service and word "PAM" indicates the authentication errors of ssh login, the two key words are effective to select matched lines.
            Something important to be noticed are the rules below :
              (*) illegal users are not recorded
              (*) if a legal user failed 1 to 3 times(ssh will fail if login failed 3 times), lines in auth.log that contain the second and third time failre
                  do not have key word "sshd" but key word "syslogd".
            
       (4). Process to deal with "audit_ip.txt" is similar to that of deal with "audit_user.txt", "audit_user.txt" focus on users while "audit_ip.txt" focus on\
            IPs. To put it simply, the content of "audit_ip.txt" can be done at the same time when processing "audit_user.txt", because the IP of user who cause
            ssh login error are in the same line.
            Something also important to be noticed are the rules below :
              (*) illegal users are "required" to be recorded
              (*) if a legal user failed 1 to 3 times(ssh will fail if login failed 3 times), lines in auth.log that contain the second and third time failre
                  do not have key word "sshd" but key word "syslogd". 
       
       (5). After processing the whole "auth.log", all the required content are recorded. At the end of command "awk", print out all the content in
            the 3 hashmaps but add the file name that corresponding line should be put in front of each line.
            The final step is to use command "awk" and ">" to write all the content to corresponding files.

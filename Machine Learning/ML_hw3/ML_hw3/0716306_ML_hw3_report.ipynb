    "First I generated 1000 float numbers for x with uniform distribution with interval [-1.5,1.0), and then generate y with the fomula given in spec.\n",

    "Because the X and y used to fit linear regression model is already done in data preprocessing, I just put these data into each linear regression model here.\n",

    "\n",
    "I put the weight of each linear regression model here with ascendent order (For example, 0.123 + 0.456 * x + 0.789 * x**2), but the LaTeX expression is shown in legend of the plot.\n",

    "To produce dataset for Logistic regression model fitting, first I random choose 1 or 0 for 1000 times, then use fucntion in numpy to draw 1000 samples from multivariate normal distribution with mean set to corresponding y.\n",
